Tv Show App 
=============================================
A project based on [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack),[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/),[MVVM architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)

**Introduction**
---------------
This project is a sample base code that implements the MVVM architecture and uses Android Jetpack.

Technical Information used in this project:

1. Programming Language: **Android Kotlin**.
2. Architecture: **MVVM architecture** based on **Android Jetpack**.
3. Android Components: (**Navigation**, **ViewModel**, **LiveData**, **Data Binding**, **Lifecycles**, **Android Material Design**,...).
4. Multiple Threads: **Kotlin Coroutine**.
5. Third Party Libraries: **Glide**, **Retrofit**,**Moshi**,...

About Android Jetpack
---------------------

Android Jetpack is a set of components, tools and guidance to make great Android apps. They bring
together the existing Support Library and Architecture Components and arrange them into four
categories:

Libraries Used
--------------

* [Foundation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
   * [AppCompat](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/packages#v7-appcompat) - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
   * [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
* [Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
   * [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
   * [Lifecycles](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
   * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
   * [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
   * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
* [UI]() - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate
  * [Animations & Transitions](https://developer.android.com/training/animation/) - Move widgets and transition between screens.
  * [Fragment](https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments) - A basic unit of composable UI.
  * [Layout](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout) - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
* Third party
  * [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) for image loading
  * [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
  * [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for Networking
  * [Moshi](https://square.github.io/moshi/1.x/moshi/) used to parsing data
  * [Paging 3.0](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) for Paging data 
  * And a few other libraries ....
